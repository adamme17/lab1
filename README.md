### GitHub Events

The goal of this task is to create an application to show GitHub events. Events API is https://api.github.com/events?page=1 (2,3 etc)
The first screen shows a list of events. Each entry has a small image (author avatar), an event type, a date of event, and an author name. When we scroll to the bottom of the current events list a new page of events must be loaded from the API.
If we click on each record we should go to the second (Details) screen. The second screen has a large image of userâ€™s avatar (top half of the screen), a repository name below, and an author name below it too.
